                <h4>What is Wet Bulb Globe Temperature?</h4>

                <p>Wet bulb globe temperature is an approximation of how well your body can cool the surface of your skin given the temperature,
                humidity, wind, and solar irradiation of the environment you are in. The wet bulb globe temperature is a more meaningful number
                than dry bulb temperature or heat index to those who are concerned with thermal stress, such as construction workers, sports teams,
                and the military (who funded the development of wbgt). For example, a partly cloudy 95 degree day with low humidity and some wind presents low risk
                for thermal stress, while a sunny 95 degree day with high humidity and no wind will present high risk for thermal stress or injury.
                Notice that the dry bulb temperature is the same for each of these days (95), and does not indicate the difference in safety. In contrast,
                the wet bulb globe temperatures would be very different and would indicate the difference in safety.</p>

                <p>Because your body is always producing thermal energy, or heat, it must always have the ability to dump heat into the environment.
                Otherwise, the heat you produce just by living would accumulate in your body, and you would heat up and die. Fortunately, the body can
                cool the environment at the surface of the skin by sweating, so that heat will move from the warmer body to the cooler skin-surface environment,
                even on a hot day. The body works to maintain an average internal temperature of 98.6 degrees Farenheight, and to do so, it must cool the
                skin-surface environment to below this temperature. In fact, because the body produces heat just by living, it actually needs to cool the
                skin-surface environment to below 95 degrees Farenheight. Wet Bulb Globe temperature (WBGT) gives the lowest temperature your body will be
                able to cool the skin surface environment, so 95 degrees Farenheight is the limit of survivability for WBGT. Though is is almost never 95
                WBGT on earth, temps can often reach the low 90s and high 80s WBGT. Additionally, the effects of climate change will result in more places
                experiencing more high-risk days for thermal stress. On days like these, people risk injury or death from thermal stress if they overwork
                themselves, do not hydrate, or ignore other precautions on a hot day.</p>

                <h4>My interest in Wet Bulb Globe Temperature</h4>

                <p>I created this site because I often use wet bulb globe temperature to determine whether it is safe to lead an outdoor adventure trip for
                my job as a trip leader. In 6 years of leading trips for various organizations I have had to cancel just once: during a 92 WBGT day intended
                for kayaking - an environment where the sun hits you from above and below. The number of high-risk days like that one will only increase with
                climate change. I have also experienced thermal stress first-hand, while mountain biking in Utah. After resting in the shade of an overhanging
                rock, I realized that some of the thoughts I had been having were not normal! They were  the unintelligible, irrational thoughts of an overheated
                brain, and in that moment I realized how dangerous thermal stress was. Since then I have used WGBT, but it hasn\'t been easy: there is no website
                that I know of that provides a WBGT forecast for any location. Instead, I usually manually enter weather data on an experimantal page of the National
                Weather Service that will calculate it for me. My hope is that this site will allow for more easily informed decision-making in high-heat environments.</p>
